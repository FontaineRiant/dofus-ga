DofusGA is a build optimizer for Dofus.

It's a powerful engine that uses a genetic algorithm to find the best items to equip given a use case, and runs 100% in the browser.

Finding the build that deals the most damage is easy. But how much sustainability are you willing to lose for it? Are crits worth losing a bit of power? You have resists but it would be better if they were about equal?

DofusGA optimizes for builds that will __win__ a fight where two characters are hitting each other. It puts everything in the balance:
 * Stats, power and crits
 * Vitality, melee, ranged and elemental resistances
 * Critical and pushback resistances
 * AP/MP parry and wisdom
 * Opponent resistances
